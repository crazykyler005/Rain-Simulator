# Rain-Simulator

Goal: The purpose of this project was to get familiar with ceating and using class objects as well as UI elements such as buttons and dropdown menus

Technologies: The python game library pygame, random number generator, mouse input, and threading

Desciption: A 2D rain simulator that has a set of droplets spawn above the screen at random y coordinates and fall below it without overlapping. As they fall, their speed increases little by little until it reaches a specific value; this is suppose to simulate gravities effect on a drop of rain. There is a UI that allows a user to use the mouse to manipulate various aspects of the environment. Additionally, rain can be replaced with snow and lightning appears with randomly generated parts that are toggleable
